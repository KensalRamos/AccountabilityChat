- Internal Structure: Organized object-oriented programming in Java. Consistent programming conventions.

Learning experiences:

It is very important and rather easy to protect a database from an injection attack. I initially put my variables directly into my PHP string and quickly realized why I shouldn't.

It is very important to plan out the software development process to ensure project completion with the appropiate requirements.
